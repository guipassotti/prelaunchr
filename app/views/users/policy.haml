    When you visit the Site, web servers collect "traffic data" (such as, for example, time and date, the address of the website from which you entered the

  %p
    Information collected by Mindfuse.io is stored in secure operating environments that are not made generally available to the public. Unfortunately, no data
    transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Mindfuse.io cannot ensure the security of any information you provide, and you
    do so at your own risk. Once Mindfuse.io receives your transmission, it will make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on its systems.

    responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.
